    // you can actually write the above input code in low level transaction and press transact -> your myUint will update.
    // but suppose you change the function signature code and dont write it as per its format, then CALLDATA won't understand it.
    // it'll then not call setMyUint function, this will directly go to fallback function, since it doesn't know, where to go.

    // when you deploy this smart contract , and then enter certain value in Wei and go to low level interactions -> CALLDATA, 
    // without entering any data, you click on Transact button, the receive function which 
    // has payable is called and it takes the value which was entered before going to low level interactions
    // in wei, and displays it below lastValueSent blue button in deployed contracts.
    // and lastFunctionCalled shows string: receive.

    // you have to use fallback function -> which literally acts as backup.
    // if you have both receive and fallback function in same smart contract, then whenever data is entered in CALLDATA,  
    // then fallback function is called, and whenever without any data, transact button is pressed, receive function is called.
    // is there is no receive function then in both cases - data entered or left empty, fallback function is called
